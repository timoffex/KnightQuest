**Version**: 4.2.15

I'm using the "A* Pathfinding Project", which you have to download and import manually. Download
the correct version at https://arongranberg.com/astar/download and then unpack the .unityproject
file (double-clicking it should do). It will create an AstarPathfindingProject directory here.
