# Attribution for sounds

All sounds are slightly edited (using Audacity, which is a great tool).

The following sounds are licensed under the Creative Commons 0 license (which I think means
attribution is not required, but I think it's good to keep around those links):

- `bow_draw` is from https://freesound.org/people/Paveroux/sounds/490556/
- `bow_release` is from https://freesound.org/people/EminYILDIRIM/sounds/536068/ (I think; the
  waveform looks the same but I forgot whether this is actually the link I used)
- `metallic_whoosh` is from https://freesound.org/people/MissCellany/sounds/240640/
- `hit_whoosh` is from https://freesound.org/people/Nic3_one/sounds/434873/
